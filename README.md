# Module_fences
My first project.
Concept of simple web page that advertises module fences. 
This projest was intended for release build but most of the graphics hadn't been delivered. 
In this form it is only a concept and this is not a production version. 
Project is built with plain JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5 (no frameworks and preprocessors). 
In section "adjust fence" click "load photo" and choose one of the example pictures from "HousesTest" folder.
